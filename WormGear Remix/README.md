# WormGear Tape puller remix
 0816 SMT Automatic Feeder tape puller modified to better fit onto the feeder. Removed as many screws/pins as I could. 
## Notes on printing and assembly
All the files need to be oriented to print correctly on your own printer.
use 0.2mm layer height for ALL parts
Use Supports for the lever

use 0.1mm layer height for the failure gear with No supports. The outer shell is made to break away "easily" some cleanup required.

for installing the puller on the feeder put the top most screw in first then slide the tape puller onto that screw and put in the bottom one. after tightening both install the bottom motor last.
