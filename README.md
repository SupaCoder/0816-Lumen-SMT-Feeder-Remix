# 0816 Lumen SMT Feeder Remix
 0816 SMT Automatic Feeder modified to work with the LumenPNP. Custom firmware written for an arduino nano with a servo sheild can run 12 feeders.

## Notes on printing and assembly
All the files need to be oriented to print correctly on your own printer.
use 0.2mm layer height for ALL parts

There is minimal post processing needed where bridging would help print things in thin air
no supports needed.

Assembly guide coming later when i have time.

Some things that i used
M3 screws for the big holes
M2.5 for the switch and servo armature and the tensioner on the lip
3D printer spring for the tape push down lever
elastic band for the spooler lever
M4 sized hole for mounting to the extrusion
